Once you have downloaded all the files submitted, you are able to run
our programs. To train our model, run RustTraining2.java. After this 
runs, the Gaussian Naive Bayes model is outputed into model2.txt. Next, 
run the RustPrediction2.java and this will predict the outputs for 
"RustTestData.txt". Finally, run Evaluation.java, and the results for 
the confusion matrix are printed in the console.
